# TODO
Mostly for me, but feel free to contribute
([if that's what you're in to][if you're into it]):

- User management (the ability to invite a user) and password recovery.
- Tests. 'Nuff said.
- Integrate GitHub and Zenhub webhooks to update data only on change.
- Add proper, reusable Bootstrap 4 form handling - ideally with a third party library.
- Add the ability to generate secret (but publicly available) board sharing links.
