# TODO
Mostly for me, but feel free to contribute
([if that's what you're in to][if you're into it]):

- User management (the abbility to invite a user) and password recovery.
- Update DRF API docs template.
- Add info about `pipelines` and `issue` endpoints to browsable API docs.
- Tests. 'Nuff said.
- Integrate GitHub webhooks to update issues data only on change and never manually invalidate them. With that the `force refresh` would only be connected to the ZenHub API, everything else should be pretty much live.
- Add proper, reusable Bootstrap 4 form handling - ideally with a third party library.
- Add the ability to generate secret (but publicly available) board sharing links.
