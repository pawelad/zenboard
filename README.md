Zenboard is a straightforward Django application that gives you the ability to
create read only [ZenHub][zenhub] boards.

Based on proof of concept by [@kuuji][kuuji] - [kuuji/dashub][kuuji dashub]

Usable at the moment, but very much a work in progress. Expect breaking changes
with each release before 1.0

## High level overview
Zenboard aims to provide an easy way to create a filtered and read only views
of a Zenhub boards. It's currently used to give customers an overview of their
issues that doesn't require double lifting (if you already use ZenHub to track 
that), allows specifying which issues and comments should be visible based on
couple of factors, and can be used without a GitHub account inside the
organization.

Caching is builtin and a priority because of the sheer number of requests to
both ZenHub and GitHub APIs needed to generate the board view and necessary
data. GitHub and ZenHub webhooks are used to refresh the cache, so the data
should theoretically always be up to date.

There is a REST API with docs for all important endpoints, courtesy of Django
REST Framework.

See [TODO.md][todo list] for current roadmap.

## Running Zenboard
Take a look [here][running zenboard] if you want to run Zenboard yourself,
either locally or in production, and [open an issue][zenboard new issue] if
you have any questions or problems.

Make sure that provided GitHub API token has access rights to the repository
you want to use and can create webhooks, which will be created automatically
on board creation.

ZenHub unfortunately doesn't allow automatic webhook creation so you need to
add it manually and point it to - `https://<zenboard_url>/webhooks/zenhub/`.

Django [Sites][django sites] framework is used to get the full URLs so make
sure that you configured your domain before creating any boards.

## Contributions
Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them, suggest enhancements,
add functionality and point out any mistakes. Thanks!

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `pytest` and `tox` on Python 3.6 with
Django 1.11 and Django REST Framework 3.7 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ tox
```
