Zenboard is a straightforward Django application that gives you the ability to
create read only [ZenHub][zenhub] boards that you can share with other people
without the need to give them access to your GitHub repository.

Still a work in progress.

Based on proof of concept by @kuuji - https://github.com/kuuji/dashub

## Contributions
Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them, suggest enhancements,

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `pytest` and `tox` on Python 3.6 with
Django 1.11 and Django REST Framework 3.7 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```
